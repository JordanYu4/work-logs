### Performance self-assessment 

Nearing three month mark at current position. I would like to do a brief reflection on how I might work harder and work smarter, so as to become a more valuable employee. 

**Current schedule sample**: 

| Time       | Activity                      |
|:-----------|:----------------------------  |
| 0930       | Arrive onsite, email admin    | 
| 1000       | Daily standup                 | 
| 1030       | Email admin and warm up       | 
| 1100       | Code                          |
| 1130       | Eat lunch, read documentation |
| 1200       | Code                          | 
| 1330       | Email admin                   | 
| 1400       | Code                          |
| 1530       | Email admin                   | 
| 1600       | Code                          |
| 1700       | Final PR, depart offsite      |  

| Activity     | Approx time spent           | 
|:-------------|:--------------------------  |
| Coding       | 5 hours                     | 
| Meetings     | 0.5 hour                    | 
| Email admin  | 2 hours                     |
| Lunch        | 0.5 hour                    |

**Productivity blockers**: 
- Undisciplined snacking 
- Undisciplined and unfocused email admin 
- Unfocused coding time 

**Action items**: 
- Time box meal and snack times 
- Time box email admin time and time box strictly 
- Enforce 90 minute coding "sprints"
