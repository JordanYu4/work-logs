In response to feedback received in yesterday's 1-on-1 meeting, I'd like to change my work flow so that I maintain performance even despite increasing responsibilities and related fatigue outside of the office. 

One thing I notice by observing my typical work schedule is that email administration and housekeeping tasks often take up the majority of the morning. I'll check email and try to clear my inboxes, but this often involves reviewing and responding to more content than is really necessary at the time. By the time I'm ready to move on to the actual coding, it's often right before or after lunch. 

I am going to shift my focused coding time to the morning, limit my morning and mid-day email admin times to ten miniutes, and then block out a time in the late afternoon to perform more in-depth follow-up. This way, I will not be rushing to make a final PR before egress, and will be less likely to fall behind on work. My goal is to make at least two PR's every day: one before lunch at 1200, and one before 1600.
