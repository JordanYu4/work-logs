### Learning points: 

* Separation of concerns 
* Changing the schema doesnâ€™t automatically run a migration for mysql; mysql also has to be edited 
* Error handling in go 
* Line spacing in go 
* SQL query refresher (multiple rows selected by default) 
* Ksuid vs. random secret function (linear algebra?) 
* Namespacing routes ("fewer locations in nginx which translates to less work devops will need to do when they remove nginx and turn it into a `k8s` cluster.")
* Serving with nginx vs. production 
* Best practice to delete old successful OTP tokens
